# Boscar Theme

This is a simple theme for the fish shell. As is the way of these things there were several prompts that I liked parts of, but none that I really liked using as a whole. So I'm pulling those things I like into a separate prompt.

## Inspiration

The prompt that's closest to what I like is the [pure](https://github.com/rafaelrinaldi/pure) prompt.
